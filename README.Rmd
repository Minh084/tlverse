## What's `tlverse`?

`tlverse` is an umbrella package for targeted learning in R.

`library(tlverse)` loads the following core packages:

* [sl3](https://sl3.tlverse.org) for Super Learning
* [tmle3](https://tmle3.tlverse.org) for TMLE (Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation)

as well as the following helper packages:

* [origami](https://origami.tlverse.org) for cross-validation
* [delayed](https://delayed.tlverse.org) for parallelizing dependent tasks

and packages for individual `tmle3` parameters:

_coming soon..._

## Installation

Some of these packages are not yet on CRAN, so for now the only option is to
install directly via github using devtools:

```r
devtools::install_github("tlverse/tlverse")
```
